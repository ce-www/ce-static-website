			<h3><em>WASTEWATER TREATMENT</em></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>East and West Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Treatment Plants, City of Atlanta, Georgia</h3>
<p>Under a US EPA and State Consent Decree, the City of Atlanta  was required to upgrade the existing 20 mgd East Combined Sewage Treatment  Facility and to construct an 85 mgd West Combined Sewage Treatment Facility to  provide high-rate treatment of combined sewage to remove inorganic and organic  material and to provide disinfection prior to discharging to tributaries of the  South River and Chattahoochee River. This project included engineering design  and construction administration services for the East CSO Treatment Plant  located at the Intrenchment Creek Water Resources Center (WRC), and the new West  CSO Treatment Plant and Sludge Pumping System at the RM Clayton WRC. </p>
<p><strong><em>Our project team was awarded a 2006 Honor Award for  Engineering Excellence by the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC)  Georgia branch in February 2006, for meeting all regulatory Consent Decree  milestone dates (over 10 milestones) and designing exceptional facilities that  met the City&rsquo;s budget requirements.</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Tasks included:</p>
<p>&bull; Design and construction administration of a sludge pumping  system, which included nine 150 gallons per minute (gpm) pumps and 1,400 lineal  feet of high density polyethylene pipe routed through an existing casement and  under an active railroad.<br />
  &bull; Design of drum screening facilities, grit removal systems,  filtration systems to remove suspended organic and inorganic material,  ultraviolet disinfection systems, sludge and backwash handling and settling  process units, ancillary systems including chemical storage and feed systems,  plant water and air supplies, odor control for screening facilities,  de-gritting and solids handling systems, as well as building and site  development.</p>
<p>Cardozo Engineering provided:<br />
  &bull; Engineering: pilot facility operation, planning, route  analysis, site investigations and hydraulic analysis, QA/QC review, preparation  of piping and instrumentation diagrams and process flow diagram, development of  process description and control philosophy, calculation of solids mass balance  and preparation of design reports, engineering drawings, specifications and  construction cost estimates. <br />
  &bull; Project Coordination: planning, preparation of project  schedules, tracking of schedules and budget, tracking of milestones and  deadlines, preparation of monthly status reports and attendance to periodic  meetings, as well as coordination with utilities and municipalities.<br />
  &bull; Construction Administration: site inspections, shop  drawing reviews, preparation of responses to Requests for Information (RFIs),  review of claim and change order submittals and review of as built drawings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>R.M. Clayton Water Reclamation Facility Upgrades, City of Atlanta, Georgia</h3>
<p>This project included the evaluation,  rehabilitation and upgrade of the 122 mgd treatment facility&rsquo;s infrastructure  and operations to improve treatment facility performance and to ensure  consistent compliance with the City&rsquo;s NPDES discharge permit. Services included  project management, engineering design and planning, field investigation,  interviews and workshops with operation and maintenance plant personnel,  reviewing as-built conditions (drawings, equipment lists, O&amp;M&nbsp; manuals), performing equipment and processes  condition assessments, preparing technical memoranda, plans and specifications,  coordinating multi-discipline engineering team, preparing Erosion &amp;  Sedimentation Control Plans and Land Disturbance Permit, obtaining regulatory  agency approval and providing utility coordination, construction cost  estimating and scheduling. Root causes of recurring problems were identified  and plans were developed and implemented to provide for long term solutions. </p>
<p>Rehabilitation projects included:<br />
  &bull; Abandonment of the existing headworks facility<br />
  &bull; Primary Chemical  Feed Facility Upgrade and Injection Optimization<br />
  &bull; New Primary Area  Electrical Building<br />
  &bull; Replacement of  Primary Scum Pumping System<br />
  &bull; Replacement of Secondary Scum  Pumping System<br />
  &bull; Primary Effluent  Channel Improvements<br />
  &bull; Primary Sludge  Pump Improvements<br />
  &bull; Primary Odor Control Improvements<br />
  &bull; Abandonment of Chlorine Building:<br />
  &bull; Primary Bypass  Flow Meter Upgrade<br />
  &bull; Anaerobic jet  mixing system for two BNR reactors<br />
  &bull; Improvements to Aeration Basin <br />
  &bull; Mixed Liquor Valve Replacement <br />
  &bull; Water Recycle Pipeline Installation under existing railroad</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Miami-Dade County&rsquo;s Biosolids Master Plan, Miami, FL</h3>
<p>This project  includes the evaluation of Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department&rsquo;s (MDWASD)  wastewater and water treatment facilities and operations, and preparation of a  county-wide master plan to address biosolids treatment and disposal over a 20  year planning horizon. Project objectives included: a) Investigating specific  biosolids management issues at each WWTP; b) Evaluating the cost and benefits  of increasing the level of treatment at all biosolids processing facilities to  meet Class AA standards; and c) Developing biosolids treatment alternatives  taking into account costs and regulations, as well as environmental and public  acceptance factors.</p>
<p>Cardozo  Engineering&rsquo;s tasks included:<br />
  &bull; Conducting  a Digester Gas Utilization Facility and Energy Management Study.<br />
  &bull; Conducting  a condition assessment of WWTP equipment.<br />
  &bull; Conducting  sampling and analysis of digester gas.<br />
  &bull; Determining  biosolids existing and projected quantities and characteristics <br />
  &bull; Evaluating  use of Sludge Energy Source at the County&rsquo;s Waste-to Energy Plant.<br />
  &bull; Preparing  a Biosolids Master Plan Report.<br />
  &bull; Analyzing  local, state and federal regulations and trends across the US regarding  treatment and final utilization of biosolids.<br />
  &bull; Providing  regulatory agency and utility coordination.</p>
<p>Detailed  tasks included:<br />
  &bull; Reviewing  current and proposed biosolids regulations which may impact MDWASD&rsquo;s biosolids  treatment and disposal alternatives. CE staff conducted meetings with federal,  state and regional agencies to promote involvement in Miami-Dade&rsquo;s master plan  development and to obtain regulatory buy-in and guidance; reviewed, evaluated  and identified regulations that may impact future biosolids treatment and  disposal, and prepared a technical memorandum.<br />
  &bull; Projecting  wastewater loadings and biosolids production.&nbsp;  CE staff reviewed population and flow projections, analyzed six years of  operations data for the North District, Central Disctrict  and South District WWTPs, and reviewed the Peak Flow Study as well as other  reports to estimate likely waste sludge and biosolids production for future  growth scenarios.<br />
  &bull; Collecting  and evaluating available plant data from the three WWTPs and identifying  planned process changes which will impact biosolids production (e.g., High  Level Disinfection)<br />
  &bull; Meeting  with potential utility partners who may utilize MDWASD's biosolids treatment  and disposal facilities to obtain and document information on their existing  and proposed future biosolids production data. These partners included: the  North Key Largo Utility Corporation, the Florida Keys Aqueduct Authority, the Everglades National Park  and the City of Homestead.<br />
  &bull; Conducting  an analysis of biosolids quality, reviewing biosolids quality characteristics,  estimating future biosolids quality taking into account expected quantities,  effects of water treatment plant solids, septage, unit processes and industrial  contributions, and preparing a technical memorandum.<br />
  &bull; Evaluating  effects of WTP solids on existing biosolids facilities operations and quality  and quantity of final biosolids currently produced, and determining if the WTP  solids can be processed in MDWASD&rsquo;s CDWWTP as a back-up alternative without  limiting handling and treatment of biosolids facilities.</p>
