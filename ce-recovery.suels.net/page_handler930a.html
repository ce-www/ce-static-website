			<h3><em>WATER</em></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Adamsville Pumping Station and 48-inch Water Main, City of Atlanta, Georgia </h3>
<p>The water supply demand in South Fulton   County is growing rapidly  as a result of residential and commercial development. This City of Atlanta project serves to  increase the transmission system capacity between the Chattahoochee Water  Treatment Plant (CWTP) and the Adamsville Pumping Station (APS), and the  pumping capacity at the booster pumping station. This project consisted of the  design of approximately 30,300 lineal feet of a new 48 inch ductile iron water  main between the CWTP and the APS, as well as additions to the 45 MGD APS.&nbsp; The routing of the new water main runs along Bolton Road and Fulton Industrial Boulevard,  crossing a number of major intersections and creeks, beneath a railroad bridge,  under Interstates 20 and 285, and located within a Georgia Power easement. The  Adamsville Pumping Station houses three split-case centrifugal booster pumps  rated at 10, 15 and 20 mgd. A new 15 mgd pump is being added along with  modifications and additions to the piping, electrical switchgear and controls.  In addition, two discharge venturi meters at the Adamsville and Northside  Pumping Stations are deteriorated and will be replaced with new units.</p>
<p>Tasks included: pump and pipeline  design to increase pump station capacity at the Adamsville Pumping Station from  45 to 60 mgd. Services included routing analysis, field investigation to locate  and identify utilities crossing proposed pipeline route and to identify other potential  routing impediments, classification of roads intersecting proposed pipeline  route as US or State routes, development of plans and specifications, cost  estimating and scheduling, and establishment of horizontal and vertical  alignment throughout with special considerations for jack &amp; bore drilling,  pipeline corrosion protection, valve appurtenances, and other constructability  issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Asset Management of Water Treatment and Transmission Facilities, City of Atlanta, Georgia</h3>
<p>This project included the assessment of  the City&rsquo;s water treatment and transmission facilities and the creation of an  asset management database and implementation tool for the City of Atlanta, Bureau of  Drinking Water. Plants included: Hemphill &amp; Chattahoochee Water Treatment  Plants, Chattahoochee Raw Water Intake &amp; Pumping Station, Northside Pumping  Station, Adamsville Pumping Station, Hartsfield Pumping Station, DuPress  Booster Station, Sandy Springs Booster Station and Welcome All Road Booster  Station. Task assignments included: inventory of all plant related assets,  historical and replacement cost analysis, determinations of treatment plant and  pump station annual operating costs (including costs for electrical power,  chemicals and labor), establishment of asset refurbishment/replacement schedule  based on criticality weighting factors and evaluations.&nbsp; Total number of assets evaluated under these  analyses exceeded 1,500.&nbsp; In addition,  plant operating and maintenance procedures, storehouse inventory practices, and  safety procedures were evaluated and procedural improvement recommendations  were provided to the Bureau in the form of a final report.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Miami-Dade Seaport Water Main Master Flow Meters Design, Miami-Dade County, Florida </h3>
<p>This project included the preliminary  design of two master flow meters to be installed on a 20 inch potable water  distribution main line servicing the Port of Miami and Fisher Island.  Engineering services included planning, site investigations, hydraulic  analysis, route analysis and preliminary design. Potential meter locations were  evaluated and identified taking into account existing site conditions,  accessibility, security, availability of straight line segments of pipe upstream  and downstream, and constructability. Evaluations were conducted on different  types of flow measuring equipment to compare accuracy, reliability,  constructability and cost. A design report was prepared that included pipeline  configuration drawings, plan and profile sheets, cost estimates, vendor data  sheets and a summary of findings and recommendations.<br />
  &nbsp;</p>
<h3>NEW PROJECTS INCLUDE:</h3>
<h3>Hialeah Water Treatment Plant Rehabilitation  and Upgrade, Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department, Miami, Florida.</h3>
<strong>A  five (5) year program to rehabilitate and upgrade the treatment plant.</strong>            <!-- End Content -->
