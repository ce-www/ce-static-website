Replacement techniques in use include pipe bursting, open cut  trenching, and horizontal directional drilling. </p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Miami-Dade County&rsquo;s Comprehensive Lateral Investigation Program (CLIP) to  Reduce Peak Flows, Miami, Florida</h3>
<p>The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) previously  completed a comprehensive infiltration/inflow (I/I) reduction program to detect  and repair groundwater and wet weather flow sources in the County wastewater  collection system. The I/I Program was successful in reducing the daily flow to  the wastewater treatment plant, but still the rainfall dependent  infiltration/inflow (RDII) flows remained high. The Department then directed  its focus to the evaluation of the public and private sewer laterals, since the  lateral sewers from the house to the collection sewer in the street were not  included in the original I/I Program. The subsequent Comprehensive Lateral  Investigation Program (CLIP) was implemented to further study the impact of  these sewers on peak flows. The first phase of the CLIP was to select a sample  of approximately thirty sewer collection basins based on high RDII levels, size  of the basin, age, zoning and location throughout Miami-Dade County,  and to determine the condition of the laterals. Hydrographs were developed for  each of the pump station basins for various rain events, before and after the  repairs of lateral defects were completed. The results of the study will be  utilized to further target and reduce RDII emanating from select pump station  basins throughout the County in order to reduce peak flows. This study was  approved by Region 4 US EPA and will serve as a model for other municipalities  throughout the United States  who are experiencing rainfall dependent Infiltration/Inflow problems that  contribute to excessive peak flow during wet weather events.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  This study included:&nbsp; <br />
  &bull; Project planning, preparation of construction documents and  administration of construction contracts.<br />
  &bull; Project scheduling.<br />
  &bull; Investigation of the condition of sewer laterals, sewer  lateral testing and inspection.<br />
  &bull; Repair of sanitary sewers.<br />
  &bull; Evaluation of infiltration and inflow, pump station and  sewer system flows, and the evaluation of rainfall and groundwater data as it  relates to the sewage flows and pump station performance.<br />
  &bull; Construction supervision, preparation of summary reports  and project recommendations.<br />
  &bull; Preparation of a comprehensive study.</p>
<p>This project also included the implementation of a  successful public information/outreach program, which included:<br />
  &bull; Preparing and mailing out 9,200 letters to property owners  requesting permission to enter private property. Letters were prepared in three  languages (English, Spanish and Creole).<br />
  &bull; Coordinating mailing letters to property owners.<br />
  &bull; Preparing door hangers distributed prior to working in  area.<br />
  &bull; Preparing 250 letters to property owners informing them of  lateral pipeline defects.<br />
  &bull; Establishing a customer relations call center to promptly  respond to property owners&rsquo; concerns.<br />
  &bull; Developing a database of the properties in the study area  to include property owner data, folio numbers, property addresses and mailing  addresses.<br />
  &bull; Developing a Customer Service database to track calls from  property owners, requests for information, and program participation  responses.&nbsp; Responses were received from  71% of property owners and over 96% of these responders voluntarily elected to  participate in MDWASD&rsquo;s program. This study was approved by Region 4 US EPA and  will serve as a model for other municipalities throughout the United States  who are experiencing rainfall dependent Infiltration/Inflow problems that  contribute to excessive peak flow during wet weather events.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Miami-Dade Seaport Condition Assessment of 8-inch Force Main, Miami, Florida</h3>
<p>The Port of Miami utilizes a single 8&rdquo; diameter  ductile iron sanitary force main constructed in 1964 to convey sewage from the  Port to the wastewater treatment plant. Three lift stations convey sewage  through the force main from the Port, beneath Biscayne Bay  and onwards to the Miami Mainland. Due to the current age of the pipeline, the  Port was concerned about pipeline integrity due to the possible detrimental  effects associated with soil corrosion and internal corrosion due to the  presence of Hydrogen Sulfide, hydraulic surges, and tidal effects (including  storms).&nbsp; Since the pipeline extends  under Biscayne Bay, which is a protected  pristine marine estuary, the Port was concerned about the potential for sewage  releases into the Bay and subsequent environmental impacts. The force main is also  the only means for removing sanitary waste from the Port, and any interruption  in this line would be detrimental to not only the Port but its customers, which  primarily includes the cruise ship industry.<br />
  &nbsp;</p>
Cardozo Engineering staff performed a search of both  historical records and relevant &ldquo;as-built&rdquo; drawings, a physical site inspection  and condition assessment of the lift stations and pipeline, and met with Port  maintenance personnel in order to develop an in-depth understanding as to the  present day condition of the pipeline. Historical and current flow data and  pump schedule data were obtained in order to develop a capacity utilization  study of the force main system. The purpose of this task was to determine  whether current flow patterns had been modified much over the years, whether  original design capacities were being exceeded due to increased pumping  capabilities and demands, and if the capacity had been compromised due to  possible air entrainment.&nbsp; A detailed  Technical Memorandum of findings, procedures, cost estimates, and  recommendations were prepared. Special considerations detailed in this report  examined the problematic nature of the underwater leg of the pipeline and the  environmental concerns associated with this particular segment of piping, the  need to provide uninterrupted service for the Port and its customers, the  evaluation of cost effective alternatives, alternative route locations, and to  integrate master planning features to ensure the long-term serviceability of  the force main system, taking into account future Port expansions.            <!-- End Content -->
